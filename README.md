# Prompt-Engineering-on-Llama-2-Chat-model-
Summary
This code demonstrates the implementation of a natural language processing (NLP) model using the LLaMA-2-7b model from Meta, facilitated by the Hugging Face Transformers library. The model is utilized for various tasks such as text classification, translation, and custom text generation through different prompting techniques, including zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and chat-based prompting.

Key components of the implementation:

Model and Tokenizer Initialization:

Load the LLaMA-2-7b model and tokenizer.
Deploy the model on a CUDA-enabled GPU if available.
Function Definition:

Define get_llama2_chat_response(prompt, max_new_tokens=50) function to generate responses for given prompts.
Prompting Techniques:

Zero-Shot Prompting: Classify sentiments and translate text without prior examples.
Few-Shot Prompting: Generate text based on given examples.
Chain-of-Thought Prompting: Step-by-step reasoning for mathematical and logical questions.
Chat Prompting: Simulate chat responses with specific constraints such as quoting from a TV show or using only emojis.
